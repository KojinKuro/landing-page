# FlexBox Landing Page

## üìù Description

This is a landing page built to practice FlexBox as a tool for laying out pages. A design comp was given [Desing Comp 1](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png), [Design Comp 2](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png) and the goal was to match it as closely as possible using CSS skills and FlexBox. Using Flexbox was challenging. In hindsight, using CSS Grid would have been better in certain places mixed with FlexBox, but I did not know FlexBox at the time of doing this project. Through completing the project, I got a better understanding of the basics of CSS and FlexBox. This was early on in my journey learning CSS. As such the CSS is a bit messy and could be organized better. This was also before I learned SASS which would improve the page, had I used with it.
